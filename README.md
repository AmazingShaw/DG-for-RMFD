# Domain Generalization Repository for Rotating Machinery Fault Diagnosis from HNU Intelligent Fault Diagnosis Group
### Description of DG methods for RMFD
There are eight typical DG methods for RMFD, including AGG, a baseline method that directly aggregates all source-domain data to train a model; four domain alignment methods, DANN, MMD, CORAL, and triplet loss; a data augmentation method, multi-domain Mixup; a meta-learning method, MLDG; and an ensemble learning method, DAEL. Since Our repository is used to process one-dimensional signals, so we made some changes on the model structure and hyperparameters of the methods compared with the original settings. The detailed information on these methods can be found in
